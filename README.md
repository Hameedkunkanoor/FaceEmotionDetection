## Usage

1.    First you need to install all the requirements in a new environment preferably. 
     you can follow this guide to create new Anaconda environment with these packages 
    [Creating a deep learning environment in anaconda python](https://medium.com/@hameedkunkanoor/setting-up-a-deep-learning-environment-and-virtual-environment-in-python-a2083b25914a)

2.    Run EmotionDetection.py file which processed the data and creates new model for predicting the face emotions.

  
    python EmotionDetection.py
    
3.    Now we will run Detector.py file which uses the model and perform predictions on the webcamera feed

     python Detector.py
